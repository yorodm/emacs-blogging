I'm working on a new feature to include *tags* in the blog posts. This is a
result of referring to many org-publish based blogs. The work is too early to be
merged into the master branch but you can find the current state of work in the
[[https://gitlab.com/psachin/psachin.gitlab.io/-/tree/tags/][tags]] branch. Below are the two very early screenshots.
