I brought this *Vostok Amphibia 670* series watch which is the second Automatic
watch in my possession. It fits perfectly on my wrist because of its 41 mm dial
and silicon straps. It appears classic because the dial has light Bluish Grey
color on top of Black background. It has a white strip and a lume dot to mark
every hour with three black strips between each hour. The 12 is marked with Red
arrow with classic /Amphibia/ signature below.

The Vostok Amphibia 670927 has 2415 automatic in-house movement with no
complications. Also there is no hacking(sadly). The power reserve as per the
user guide says "not less that 33 hrs". It has 31 ruby jewels, shock resistance
balance and 20 ATM water-resistance.

This is the my first automatic watch with 20 ATM WR(perfect diving watch) and
rotating bezel. The watch is quite heavy, may be because if the bezel(which is
4mm depth). The bezel rotation is smooth but firm so you don't have to worry
about unwanted bezel rotation on minor touches. The bezel has 10, 20, 30, 40,
and 50 black markings with 12 marked with a white circle. I like the
combinations of color used on this watch which is a mix of everything from
black, white, Grey, blue(ish) and Red. Besides the retro look in combination
with chunkier bezel feels robust. I like the way the dial colors plays with the
light which appears completely Grey sometime but will also match a blue shade
attire. The quality of silicon strap is great and perfect to wear in the
Summers. Although I'm guessing how NATO straps will look on this watch.

Almost all of the front is in high polish and the caseback is brushed with
"Amphibian" signature and water resistance indication.

The crown is "huge"(and it looks good by the way) and you have to /unscrew/ it
before winding or performing time adjustments.

It is very early to share the performance review of this watch but I'll share a
second review after some good use.
