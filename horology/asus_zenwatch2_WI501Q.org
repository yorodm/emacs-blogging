After 3 years(I brought it on Oct 22, 2016) of use I'm finally writing a review
of my **ASUS Zenwatch2**. This was my first smartwatch and I spend a good amount
of time to convince myself to buy it and the device never disappointed me. I
choose to have the one with 1.63" dial. It comes with all sorts of features
mentioned [[https://www.asus.com/us/ZenWatch/ASUS_ZenWatch_2_WI501Q/Features/][here]] and syncs pretty well the any Android phone.

The photos you see were taken today and as seen the device is in very good state
after regular use. I wear it everyday during my evening walk just to see the
distance covered and the calories burned ;-) Of course the strap in the photos
is not the original strap that came with the watch(the original leather strap is
still intact and occasionally switch to it). This one with white stitches on
black leather suits even better with the watch.

If you want to look at the specs, I have put them below:

I never used the stock ROM which came with the watch. Soon after it arrived, I
flashed it with **AsteroidOS**. You can read the entire post [[../hack_your_wrist.html][here]].
**AsteroidOS** has very good community support and most of the features works.
It is worth trying.

I think what made me stick to this watch was I flashed it many times and
simultaneously switched between **Wear OS** and **AsteroidOS** whenever I was
bored. I still love using [[https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb][adb]] to sneak into the device and with AsteriodOS you
can even SSH into the watch. Below are few lines of bash history:

What I love about this watch is that I have a precise timekeeping device with
all the complications like Day-Date, Battery status, Second timezone, Step count
on a single screen. With Bluetooth ON and **Always-on screen** turned off, the
Watch goes up to 2 days on battery. On **Airplane mode** and **Always-on
screen** turned off, the Watch stay for more than 5 days with less than 10%
battery. If **Battery Saver on**, it stays for 7 days. This is a reliable device
for travel because you don't have to worry about the regional time change. The
watch syncs with the Phone and auto adjust to the destination timezone.

With the HyperCharge, the watch is 100% charged in less than 60 mins. The only
issue I face is I need to cleanup the charging contacts from time-to-time as
they easily loose contact with the charger points due to sweat and dirt.

I'm currently using an [[../zw2_wear2_ota.html][unofficial update]]. ASUS ZenWatch2 is quite a piece and in
my experience with continuous experimenting & flashing the watch, I can say that
the hardware is very stable. The Battery performance is quite incredible till
now. I must say that the device has served me well.
