      - [X] De Broglie wavelength(/Lui De Broy/)
        - Energy of particle or wave packet: E = h\nu (where h is Planck
          constant = 6.626 x 10^-34 J.s)
        - Einstien equation: $$E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2$$
        - For a particle moving closely to the speed of light, m = 0

          $$\therefore E^2 = p^2 c^2$$

          $$\therefore h^2 \nu^2 = p^2 c^2$$

          $$\therefore h \nu = pc$$

          $$\therefore \frac{h}{p} = \frac{c}{\nu}$$

          $$\therefore \frac{h}{p} = \lambda$$

      - [X] Significance of \psi^2

        - Schrodinger proposed the equation to mathematically interpret the wave
          nature of the electron. He assumed that te wave nature of the electron
          can be explained using the /charge density/ similarly to the spread of
          water to see it's wave like nature, we have to spread the charge of an
          electron to study it as a wave. But he failed to explain it. Later,
          Max Born discarded the idea of /charge density/ and instead suggested
          that to square \psi to get the probability of finding the electron in
          space.

         - [X] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKUSWJWMSk4][The Hidden beauty of Rainbows]]
           - Highlights:
             - The Red color(~42^o)(radius) is on the outside and the
               blue(~40^o) is on the inside of the primary bow. This is reversed
               for the secondary bow which is 10_{o} higher in the sky.
             - The sky is much brigher in the inside of the primary bow(due the
               the white light).
             - The refraction index of Water(n_{1} = ~1.33) is 33% more than
               that of Air and Vaccum(n_{2} = ~1.00). This means the light
               travels 33% slower in the Water than Air and Vaccum.
             - Snell's Law: $$n_{1} sin \alpha = n_{2} sin \beta$$
               - Where \alpha is the /angle of incident/ & \beta is the /angle
                 of refraction/.
               - If \alpha = \beta, the light travels in the straight line.

               \phi_{max}.

             - Highlights:
               - Hooke's Law
               - Measuring the mass in outer space?
               - Period of a spring:

                 $$T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{m}{k} }$$

                 where /m/ is the mass of the object and /k/ is spring constant.

               - Period of a Pendulum

                 $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$$

                 where /l/ is the length of the string and /g/ is the gravity.
