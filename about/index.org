  I try not to be biased with any programming language or technology. I work on
  GNU/Linux and Free & Open Source Software for living. I prefer to use Google
  products at minimum and use [[https://duckduckgo.com/][duckduckgo]] to search the Web using
  [[https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/][privateinternetaccess]] VPN service. If you are passionate about GNU and Free
  Software like me, I encourage you to watch this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er1pM9suxvE][YouTube video]] by Benjamin Mako
  Hill.

** @Home

   My current system is [[https://plus.google.com/photos/photo/113870692888444102463/6355020254313100738?icm=false&sqid=104043194426129544738&ssid=2c4bb3f4-0eed-4d83-9385-eb6e51a01dc9][Lenovo G505s]] with AMD A8 Quad-core processor and 8 Gigs
   of RAM running Slackware 14.1(I always prefer [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/bash_scripts/blob/master/build_my_kernel.sh][latest kernel]]. I usually work
   on this system.

   My other system includes /Acer emachines eM350/ netbook running [[https://manjaro.org/][Manjaro Linux]]
   an independently developed [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]]. I've [[http://awesomewm.org][Awesome window manager]] on it. I
   use it as a hotspot using [[https://github.com/psachin/hotspotd][hotspotd]]. +I also have an old desktop with AMD
   Athlon with 2 Gigs of RAM running+ +Slackware again!. The system's storage is
   shared via NFS across my home network, basically this is my NFS server.+

   Apart from this I had a very old Intel Pentium II Machine with 350MHz
   processor and 64MB of RAM running Vector Linux. +I wonder how this machine

   Most of my home network and Internet connection is managed by D-LINK DIR-615E
   wireless router flashed with custom [[https://openwrt.org/][OpenWRT(barrier-breaker)]]. This is my
   backup(and tiny) Linux system with minimal shell and =opkg= package manager.

** @Work

   For work, I use Lenovo Thinkpad T440p running [[https://getfedora.org/][Fedora]]. I work on [[https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights][Red Hat
   Insights]]. Watch this introductory [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfRnKe-xxLM][YouTube video]] to know more about Red Hat
   Insights.

** Tools I use

   #+ATTR_HTML: :class center no-border
   [[file:../../images/about/tools-server-small.png]]

   [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] and a terminal are the essential tools I need. However I manage
   most of the shell tasks from Emacs.

   I prefer to use latest Emacs version. My Emacs is heavily [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/emacs.d][configured]] for all
   my needs from programming(Python, Django, C, elisp, Ruby, shell etc.), blogs
   & note taking[[https://orgmode.org/][(org-mode)]], agenda, eshell, tramp, [[https://opensource.com/article/19/1/how-use-magit][magit]] etc. Recently I fell in
   love with =M-x emacs-timemachine=. Terminal is occasionally needed to keep
   some front-end jobs running.

   [[http://git-scm.com][Git]] is something I can't live without. I use Git to keep track of my personal
   notes, blogs, and all the projects. =magit= is a savior. It helps me a lot to
   learn insights of Git.

   I prefer [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusTutorial][Gnus]] over [[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]] to manage mails.

** More..

   I find programming in =elisp= relaxing when I'm bored with Python and
   friends. Occasionally I do write helper functions and share it on
   [[http://sachin.pythonanywhere.com][sachin.pythonanywhere.com]].

** Blogs

   For raw/old posts please visit [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/blog-posts][blog-posts]]. Most of them are written in
   [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. +I now use [[https://jekyllrb.com/][jekyll]] to publish my blogs(Source [[https://github.com/psachin/psachin.github.io][here]]).+ +Jekyll uses
   markdown which I don't like much. I miss org-mode to post blogs.+ This
   website is [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/psachin.gitlab.io][entirely published]] using org-mode.
