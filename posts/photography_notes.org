*** Aperture
    - Amount of light you want to allow by varying the size of the hole
    - Range is 2.8f to 22f
    - 2.8f will allow more light than 22f because 2.8f is actually 1/2.8f.
      Meaning 1/2.8f > 1/22f.
    - Examples:
      - lower f will have sharp object with blur backgroud
      - higher f is used for landscape
*** shutter-speed
    - higher shutter speed:
      - low light
      - motion blur
    - short shutter speed
      - sport or wild life event
    - Underexposure: small aperture, short shutter speed
    - Overexposure: Large aperture, high shutter speed
*** ISO
    - Sensitivity of the sensor
    - Higher ISO may lead to grainy images
    - Example:
      - sunset: where the light is low but depends on Aperture & Shutter speed
