I have few updates related to [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/setV][setv]]. Last week I implemented new changes in
=setv= to /support Python3 by default/, this is a major change. The detailed
usage instructions can be found in the [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/setV/blob/master/ReadMe.org][ReadMe]].

A screen-cast recorded using [[https://asciinema.org][asciinema]] can be found below:

As you may have noticed, I migrated the project from [[https://github.com/psachin/setV][GitHub]] to [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/setV][GitLab]]. Enjoy the
[[https://gitlab.com/psachin/setV/tags/1.0][latest version]] and as always contributions are welcome.
