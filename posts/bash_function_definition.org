In this post I'll walk you through few commands which will help to
find the location & definition of Bash functions.

I have lot of custom Bash functions for every seldom and frequent
tasks. Usually I like to store these functions in =~/.bashrc= file but
when they grow in size and importance, I like to keep it in a separate
Bash script and =source= this script from =~/.bashrc=. As these Bash
scripts goes on increasing and so does the functions, it becomes
tedious to locate these functions.

Unlike =which= command, which is used to find a program file location,
we can't use it to find Bash function location. But there is a way we
can read the function definition and also find its location.

** Read function definition

=type= can be used to read function definition.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  type -a <FUNCTION-NAME>
#+END_SRC

For example, I have a function called =mcd= to create new directory
and =cd= in to it. The following command will print the function
definition
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  type -a mcd
#+END_SRC

Output:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell -n
  # mcd is a function
  mcd () {
      if [ "$#" -eq 1 ]; then
	  mkdir --parents "$1";
	  cd "$1";
      else
	  echo "Usage: mcd <DIR_NAME>" > /dev/stderr;
      fi
  }
#+END_SRC


*** Update (2016-04-06 Wed)

I you enable shell debug ON USING =set -e=, you can still read a
function definition.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n
  set -e
  which mcd
#+END_SRC

** Find function location in a file

In the similar way =declare= can be used to locate the function.

To locate the function, turn on shell debugging using
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  shopt -s extdebug
#+END_SRC

and then
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  declare -F <FUNCTION-NAME>
#+END_SRC

For example, to find =mcd='s location, type
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  declare -F mcd
#+END_SRC

Output:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mcd 51 /home/sachin/.bashrc
#+END_SRC


/51/ is the line number in file =~/.bashrc= where =mcd= is defined.

Finally turn off shell debugging.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  shopt -u extdebug
#+END_SRC

** Custom function

Its better to write a custom function(=whichf= in this case) using
above commands.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell -n
  function whichf () {
      if [ ${1} ]; then
	  shopt -s extdebug
	  declare -F ${1}
	  shopt -u extdebug
	  type -a ${1}
      else
	  echo "Error: Expected Function name as an argument!"
      fi
  }
#+END_SRC

Copy above function in =~/.bashrc= file and source the file using
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  source ~/.bashrc
#+END_SRC

Now call this function by typing
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  whichf <FUNCTION-NAME>
#+END_SRC

For example
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  whichf mcd
#+END_SRC

#+INCLUDE: "../disquss.inc"
