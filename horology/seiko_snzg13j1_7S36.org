This is the first automatic mechanical watch in my possession and what better
than a *Seiko 5 Sports*. The photos you see is after 1.8 years of usage. I've
replaced the original metal straps with 22mm Nylon Khaki strap and it looks more
/sportier/ to me.

At the time when I brought [[../asus_zenwatch2_WI501Q.html][ASUS ZenWatch2]] a friend of mine suggested to go for a
Seiko Automatic watch. He introduced me to couple to Manual and Automatic
watches but I was not very convinced. However the idea stuck with me until a
year back when eventually I decided to have a Seiko. This is made in Japan
verses the model *SNZG13K1* which is assembled in Malaysia.

I often switch between [[https://www.amazon.com/Ritche-Watch-Straps-Nylon-Replacement/dp/B07QHB5BD5][Nylon]], [[https://fullmosa.hk/collections/22mm/products/4-colors-for-wax-watch-band-18mm-20mm-22mm-24mm][Leather]] and the original Stainless steel bracelet
depending on the event. The watch looks good on all the straps.

This is a best field watch one can have and is recommended for those who want to
buy their first automatic watch. The dial has Black (mate) background with White
markings, numerals and watch hands. The bezel is fixed and brushed(or I would it
has not bezel as such) The Dial has depth for hands and where the hours as
marked in numerals from 1 to 12 and from 13 to 24(in small case) inwards. The
*SEIKO* branding emerges form the background with *5* badging below it. The 5
represents the five features of this watch mentioned below:

1. Automatic mechanism
2. Day-Date display
3. Water Resistance(This one is 100 Meters WR. Good for diving.)
4. Diaflex(High durable main spring)
5. Shock Resistance

The outer ring, which is placed higher than the dial and has lume strips at
every hour. Seiko uses its own proprietary *Lumibrite* paint for lumes and has
very good light emission even with couple of minutes of light exposure. The
Hour, Minute hand is lumed as well. The Day-Date window is placed at 3 O'clock
as White on Black background.

The crown is not signed and the size of the crown matches the width of the
watch. The grip is good for performing time and day-date adjustments. It has two
pull up positions for adjusting time and day-date. The crown is not screw down
and there is no hacking and no manual winding.

It has an exhibition caseback and the glass has *SEIKO* branding with water
resistance indication, caliber details.

The watch is pretty accurate at timekeeping and kick starts even with the
slightest movement. Although it is recommended to give it a horizontal swings
for at least 30 seconds to avoid gain or loss. I've never encountered any issue
till now and glad to have this in my collection.
