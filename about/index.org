   /Free Software Developer, FOSS enthusiast, & GNU Emacs Hacker./

   I work on GNU/Linux and Free & Open Source Software for a living. I prefer
   not to use [[https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/][Proprietary Software]] in-person or at work. I have now switched
   completely to [[https://duckduckgo.com/][DuckDuckGo]] as my default Search Engine. I switch between [[https://www.torproject.org/][Tor]] &
   [[https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/][VPN service]] when online. If you are passionate about GNU and Free Software
   like me, I encourage you to watch the following YouTube video by Benjamin
   Mako Hill.

** My work-space

   #+HTML: <img class='center' src='/images/about/workspace.svg' alt='My real workspace' />

   For personal use, I have [[https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/lenovo/g-series/g505s/][Lenovo G505s]] with AMD A8 Quad-core processor and 8
   Gigs of RAM running Slackware 14.1(I always prefer the [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/bash_scripts/blob/master/build_my_kernel.sh][latest kernel]]. I
   usually work on this system.

   My other system includes /Acer emachines eM350/ netbook running [[https://manjaro.org/][Manjaro Linux]]
   an independently developed [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]]. I've [[http://awesomewm.org][Awesome window manager]] on it. I
   use it as a hotspot using [[https://github.com/psachin/hotspotd][hotspotd]]. +I also have an old desktop with AMD
   Athlon with 2 Gigs of RAM running+ +Slackware again!. The system's storage is
   shared via NFS across my home network, basically, this is my NFS server.+

   +Apart from this, I had a very old Intel Pentium II Machine with a 350MHz+
   +processor and 64MB of RAM running Vector Linux. I wonder how this machine
   [[./../photography/vector.html][still runs?]]+

   Most of my Home network and Internet connection is managed by D-LINK DIR-615E
   wireless router flashed with custom [[https://openwrt.org/][OpenWRT(barrier-breaker)]]. This is my
   backup(and tiny) Linux system with minimal shell and =opkg= package manager.

   For work, I use Lenovo Thinkpad +T440p+ [[../photography/thinkpad_t490s.org][T490s]] running [[https://getfedora.org/][Fedora]]. I work on [[https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights][Red
   Hat Insights]]. Watch this introductory [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfRnKe-xxLM][YouTube video]] to know more about Red
   Hat Insights.

** Tools I use

   #+ATTR_HTML: :class center no-border
   [[file:../../images/about/tools-server-small.png]]

   [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] and a terminal are the essential tools I need. However, I manage
   most of the shell tasks from Emacs.

   I prefer to use the latest Emacs version. My Emacs is heavily [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/emacs.d][configured]] for
   all my needs from programming(Python, Django, C, elisp, Ruby, shell, etc.),
   blogs & note-taking[[https://orgmode.org/][(org-mode)]], agenda, eshell, tramp, [[https://opensource.com/article/19/1/how-use-magit][magit]], etc. Recently I
   fell in love with =M-x emacs-timemachine=. The Terminal program is
   occasionally needed to keep some front-end jobs running.

   [[http://git-scm.com][Git]] is something I can't live without. I use Git to keep track of my personal
   notes, blogs, and all the projects. =magit= is a savior. It helps me a lot to
   learn insights of Git.

   I prefer [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusTutorial][Gnus]] over [[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]] to manage E-mails. I use [[http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/info.html][Mplayer]] to play media files.
   I plan to switch to {Open, NET}BSD when Linux goes out of the market but
   still prefer to use GNU software.

   I find programming in =elisp= relaxing when I'm bored with Python and
   friends. Occasionally I do write helper functions and share it on
   [[http://sachin.pythonanywhere.com][sachin.pythonanywhere.com]]. Most of these helper functions can be found within
   my [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/emacs.d][Emacs configuration]] now. I majored in Physics with a specialization in
   Solid State Physics. In my free time, I engage myself in studying Physics,
   Mathematics, Electronics, and [[../horology/][Horology]].

** Blogs

   #+HTML: <img class='center' src='/images/about/pencil.svg' alt=Pencil' />

   For raw/old posts please visit [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/blog-posts][blog-posts]]. Most of them are written in
   [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. +I now use [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] to publish my blogs(Source [[https://github.com/psachin/psachin.github.io][here]]).+ +Jekyll uses
   markdown which I don't like much. I miss org-mode to post blogs.+ This
   website is [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/psachin.gitlab.io][entirely published]] using org-mode.

       USB-modeswitch was also quite new.
